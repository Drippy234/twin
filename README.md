## Basic Details
### Team Name: Solo Dev

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abhishek Sivadasan - [TOCH INSTITUE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY]

### Project Description
Twin Finder is a fun web app that lets you find your celebrity or cartoon lookalike by uploading a photo. It‚Äôs completely useless‚Ä¶ but entertaining!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are curious to see which celebrity or cartoon character they resemble, even though no one really needs this.
