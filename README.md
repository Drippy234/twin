# Twin Finder üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Solo Dev

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abhishek Sivadasan - [TOCH INSTITUE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY]

### Project Description
Twin Finder is a fun web app that lets you find your celebrity or cartoon lookalike by uploading a photo. It‚Äôs completely useless‚Ä¶ but entertaining!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are curious to see which celebrity or cartoon character they resemble, even though no one really needs this.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Upload your photo, select ‚ÄúCelebrity‚Äù or ‚ÄúCartoon‚Äù mode, and get instant, funny lookalike results!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
**For Software:**
- Python
- Gradio (Web UI)
- DeepFace (Celebrity lookalike)
- Optional: Cartoon API (Stable Diffusion / DALL¬∑E)
- OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow

**For Hardware:**
- None (runs entirely on web)

### Implementation
**For Software:**

# Installation
